 This process often includes forecasting revenue, expenses, and cash flows, while also considering factors like market trends, growth rates, and industry benchmarks. By using formulas, functions, and data manipulation techniques in Excel, financial modelers can build complex models that assist in understanding potential outcomes, identifying risks, and optimizing strategies.
